The Delta Method
  - To calculate the slope at a particular point of a curve.
    - It uses the difference between two points to calculate the slope (P and Q)
  - Denotated by m = Δy / Δx
    - Which means, the change in y divided by the change in x
    - Which can be represented as m = y2 - y1 / x2 - x1
      - That's the differentiation between two points.
  - The closer Q becomes to P, the closer the slope m comes to being the true tangent of the point P.

- Derivative notations:
  - Differentiation operator: y = d / dx 
  - First derivative: 
    - y (dot above y) -> Newton's notation
    - y' -> Modern way
    - f'(x) 
    - dy/dx -> Leibniz's notation
  - Second derivative:
    - y (2 dots above y) -> Newton's notation
    - y'' -> Modern way
    - f''(x) 
    - d(2)y/dx(2) -> x and d squared

- Differentiation rules
  - Derivative of a constant: d/dx c = 0 assuming c is a constant
    - A constant has no variation so its slope is nothing.
  - The Power Rule
    - d/dx x(n) = nx(n-1)
      - The derivative of an 'x' to the power of 'n', is equal to 'n' times 'x' powered to the 'n'-1
      - e.g. d/dx x(4) = 4x(3)
  - The constant multiple rule
    - d/dx (cy) = c d(dx) (y) = c dy/dx
      - e.g. assuming y = x(4) and dy/dx = 4x(3)
        - d/dx 2y = 2 dy/dx = 2(4x(3)) = 8x(3)
  - The Sum Rule
    - d(y+w)/dx = dy/dx + dw/dx
  - The Product Rule
    - d(wz)/dx = w dz/dx + z dw/dx
    - Useful whenever product is incalculable pre-diff
  - The Quotient (i.e., Fraction) Rule
    d/dx (w/z) = (z dw/dx - w dz/dx) / z²	
  - The Chain Rule
    - Denoted by dy/dx = dy/du * du/dx
    - Based on nested functions (a.k.a. composite functions)
      - The chain rule is an easy way to find derivative of nested functions (very common in ML)
    - Many applications within ML:
      - Gradient descent in general
      - Critical for backpropagation algo used to train neural nets
    - If we have y = (2x²	+8)²	
      1. We separate it in two different functions:
        - u = 2x²	+ 8 
          - du/dx = 4x
        - y = u²	 
          - dy/du = 2u
          -       = 2(2x²	+ 8)
          -       = 4x²	+ 16
      2.  Then we apply the chain rule
        - dy/dx = dy/du * du/dx
                = (4x² + 16)(4x)
                = 16x³ + 64x
