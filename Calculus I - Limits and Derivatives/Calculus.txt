- Calculus
    - Mathematical study of continuous change
    - It has two branches:
        - Differential calculus
        - Integral calculus

-- Differential calculus
    - Study of rates of change.
    - Used to calculate slopes (derivatives).
    - Applications: Optimize by finding minima and maxima of curves.
        - Used in engineering (max strength)
        - Used in finance (min cost)
        - Used in ML, including Deep Learning.
            - Gradient descent to minimize cost.
            - Gradient ascent to maximize reward.
        - Higher-order derivatives used in "fancy" optimizers.

- Integral calculus
    - Study of areas under curves.
        - Identifying area of a shape
    - Facilitates the inverse of differential calculus.
    - Applications:
        - Receiver operating characteristic
            - Binary Classification models.
        - Probability theory's "expectation" of random variable in ML, and DL.

- The Method of Exhaustion
    - Allow us to identify the area of shapes.
    - It can find area of curved shapes.
        - It uses polygons with more and more sides (more curved) until we have
        infinite sides, in which after calculating the area, we will have the area
        of the circle.
    - Calculus in general relies on the idea of approaching infinity.
        - Leibniz gave this field the name "Calculus of the infinitesimals"

- Limits
    - Easy to calculate for continuous function.
    - In some cases, we can solve the limit through algebra
        - Factoring
    - Applications
        - To define derivatives, essential for Gradients.
        - Gradient Descent and Optimization
