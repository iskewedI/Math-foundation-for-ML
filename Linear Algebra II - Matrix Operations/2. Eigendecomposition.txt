- Eigendecomposition
    - It reveals characteristics of the matrix:
        - Is singular if and only if any of its eigenvalues are zero.
        - Under specific confitions, can optimize quadratic expressions:
            - Maximum of f(x) = largest eigenvalue.
            - Minimum of f(x) = smallest eigenvalue.

    - It's not possible with all matrices, and in some cases it involves complex
    numbers instead of real ones.
    - In ML, we typically work with real symmetric matrices, which are efficient to
    decompose into real-only eigenvectors and real-only eigenv alues.
