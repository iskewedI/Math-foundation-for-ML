- Quantifying Uncertainty and Building A.I Systems that works well despite it.

- Probability Theory
    - Mathematical study of procesesses that include uncertainty.
    - Probabilities expressed over range of 0 (will not happen) to 1 (will happen)
    - Enables models of future non-deterministics events based on historical data.
        - Statistics
            - Quantifies confidence in inferences based on probabilistic events.
            - Provides framework for supporting or rejecting hypotheses.
        - Machine learning
            - Modeling approach that scales to large, high-dimensional data.
    - Key concepts
        - Law of large numbers
        - Random variables
        - Probability distributions
        - Central limit theorem
