- The Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
    - Quantifies the performance of a Binary Classifier Model.
    - The objectives is to have an algorithm that fills as much of the space
    under the ROC Curve as possible.

- Integral Calculus
    - Is the study of areas under curves.
    - It facilitates the inverse of differential calculus.
        - It also finds areas more generally, volumes and central points.
        - Is kinda the opposite of differentiation (see the power rule)
    - We use Slices that corresponds with rectangular areas underneath a curve,
    adding their widths, to estimate the area under the curve.
    - Notation:  ∫2x dx
        - Integral symbol (indefinite): ∫
        - Function to integrate: 2x
        - Variable to integrate along: dx

    - 3 more important rules
        - Power Rule
            -  ∫x^n dx = x^n+1/n+1 + C  <- Constant that may habe been lost by
                                            differentiation.
            - n can't be -1 (it will result in a division by zero error)
        - The Constant Multiple Rule
            -  ∫c f(x) dx = c  ∫f(x) dx + C
                - If we have a constant inside the integral, we can ignore it and
                use it later on (add it outside the integral)
        - The Sum Rule
            -  ∫(f(x)+g(x)) =  ∫f(x)dx +  ∫g(x)dx + C
            - If we are adding together functions inside a integral, we can
            calculate the integral of each one and then add them.


- Definite Integrals
    - Instead of being interested of the entire area under the curve (indefinite),
    we are interested of a particula range (definite range).

    - Notation:     x2
                - ∫   f(x)dx
                    x1
        - where x1 is the start of the range and x2 the end of it.

    - Process
        - First, we need to calculate the DEFINITE integral of the equation.
        - Then, we substitute x1 for x in the resulting equation.
            - At x = x1, ...
        - Then, we substitute x2 for x in the resulting equation.
            - At x = x2, ...
        - Finally, we subtract the smaller area from the larger one, leaving us with
        the definite area of under the curve.
