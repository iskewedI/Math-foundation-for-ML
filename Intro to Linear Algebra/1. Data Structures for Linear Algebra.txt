- Algerba = Arithmetic that includes non-numerical entities like "x".
- If it has an "exponential term" (or root), it isn't lineal algebra.

- Definition
    - "Solving for unknowns within a system of linear equations"

- Possibilities:
    - Could be many equations.
    - Could be many unknowns in each equation.

- Possible results:
    - One solution
    - No solution
    - Infinite solutions

- Applications:
    - Solving for unknowns in ML algos.
    - Reducing dimensionality.
    - Recommenders
    - NLP (SVD, matrix factorization)

- Tensors:
    - "ML generalization of vector and matrices to any number of dimensions"
    - Depending on dimension, we have:
        - Dim | Name     | Example
        - 0   | Scalar   | (x)
        - 1d  | Vector   | ( [x1, x2, x3] )
        - 2d  | Matrix   | ( [x1, x2
                              x3, x4] )
        - 3d  | 3-Tensor |  3D table, like a Cube
        - nd  | n-Tensor | Higher dimension entity


-- Scalars
    - Denoted in lowercase, italics, e.g. _x_
    - Should be typed, e.g. int, float32

-- Vectors
    - Denoted in lowercase, italics, bold, e.g. _*x*_
        - The elements of the vectors are not scalars, so they are not represented by bold, just italics.
    - They represent a point in space.
        - length == 2, represents a point in a 2D matrix.
        - length == 3, represents a point in a 3D cube.

    - Vector transposition:
        - Transforms a vector from a row vector to a column vector (or viceversa).
            - Elements inside remain intact and in order.
            - e.g. from (1, 3) to (3, 1)

    - Norms:
        - Functions that quantify the vector magnitude.
        - The most important one: L² Norm
            - Measures simple (Euclidean) distance from origin (0, 0)
            - Could be notated as ||x|| (bold)
            - Calculated with np using np.linalg.norm(x)
        - Used in ML for optimization, regularization and distance measurement.
    - Unit vectors:
        - Their length is equal to 1.
            - ||x|| = 1
    - Orthogonal vectors:
        - If x(t) * y = 0
            - If the dot product is 0
        - They are at 90° to each other
        - An n-dimensional space has max n mutually orthogonal vectors.

-- Matrices
    - Two-dimensional array of numbers
    - Denoted in uppercase, italics, bold, e.g _*X*_
        - Height given priority ahead of width in notation: (Nrow, Ncol)
        - Three ros and two columns: (3, 2)
    - Individual scalar elements are denoted in uppercase, italics only
        - _X(1,2)_
    - Colon represents an entire row or column:
        - Left column of matrix _*X*_ is _*X(:, 1)*_
        - Right column of matrix _*X*_ is _*X(2, :)*_

- Generic Tensor Notation
    - Denoted using Upper-case, bold, italics, sans serif, e.g. _*X*_ (sans serif)
