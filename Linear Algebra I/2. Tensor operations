Hadamard product
    - Element-wise product.
    - Only if two tensor have the same size.
    - This is NOT matrix multiplication.

    - Mat notation => A ⊙ X

    - This means that when we do operations between two tensors with the same size, each operation is going to be made between each corresponding elements in the same coordinates.
        - [[25, 2],    +  [[ 25, 2],  = [[ 50, 4]
            [5, 26]]       [ 5, 26]]     [ 10, 52]]

- Tensor reduction
    - By adding, subtracting, multiplicating or dividing all elements of a tensor, or across a specific axis.

- Dot product
    - Both vectors must have the same length.
    - This can be denoted by:
        - x ⋅ y
        - x^Ty (mul the tranpose of X with y)
        - (x, y) (curved brackets)
    - Procedure:
        - Calculate products in an element-wise fashion.
        - Sum reductively across the products to get a scalar value.
    - This is performed at every artificial neuron in a DL network.
