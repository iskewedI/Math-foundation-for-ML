- The Fronebius Norm
    - To quantify the size of a matrix. Measured in terms of Euclidian distance.
        - The sum of the magnitude of all the vectors in X.
    - Annotated by ||X||f (small f)
    - Analogous to the L2 norm

- Matrix multiplication
    - The number of columns in the first matrix MUST match the number of rows in the second one.
    - We end up with a matrix with the same number of rows of the first matrix, and the same number of columns
    of the second one.

    - Procedure
        - We first multiply the first matrix row with the second matrix column values (element-wise)
        - Then we sum up the rows of result of the multiplications

    - Techincal info:
        - Numpy => np.dot() performs the matrix multiplication, even though technically dot products are between
        vectors only.

- Matrix inversion
    - Convenient approach for solving linear equations.
        - Alternative to manually solving with substitution or elimination.
    - Denoted as _*X*_(-1)  -> Elevated to  -1
        - Satisfies: _*X*_(-1) * X = I(n)
            - That means, if we multiply the matrix by its inverted matrix, we get an Identity matrix

    - The "regression formula" is:
        - y = Xw (w being vector of weights)
    - Assumming X(-1) exists, matrix inversion can solve for w:
        - Xw = y
        - X(-1)Xw = X(-1)y
        # Identity matrix = X(-1)X
        - I(n)w = X(-1)y
        # Identity dot another matrix results in the same matrix
        # The weights would be the inverted matrix dot the 'y' matrix (labels)
        w = X(-1)y

- Diagonal Matrices
    - Has 0s in every places instead of the elements inside the main diagonal. There,
    it has 1s.
    - Squared ones are computationally efficient for:
        - Multiplication
        - Inversion
    - If non-square, it can be efficient if:
        - h > w => adding zeros to product (h: height, w:width)
        - w > h => removing elements from product

- Orthogonal Matrices
    - Where orthonormal vectors:
        - Make up all rows
        - Make up all columns
